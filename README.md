# C-Data-Structures-Algorithms

Welcome to **C-Data-Structures-Algorithms**! This repository is a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in the C programming language. The main goal of this project is to provide a clear and educational reference for students, developers, and programming enthusiasts who wish to understand these concepts from scratch. This project is still in development.

## üìú Description

This project contains implementations of various common data structures and algorithms. Each implementation is designed to be as clear and didactic as possible, with explanatory comments in the code. The aim is to maintain a clean and consistent coding style throughout the project.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Clear Implementations:** Commented and easy-to-understand code.
- **Educational Focus:** Ideal for learning the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.
- **Modularity:** Each data structure and algorithm is located in its own files for easy navigation.
- **No External Dependencies:** Only the C standard library is used.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To compile and run any of the implementations, you will need a C compiler like `gcc`.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `gcc` installed on your system. You can check with the following command:

```bash
gcc --version
```

### Compilation

1. Clone this repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Raquezin/C-DSA.git
  ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd C-DSA
  ```

3. Navigate to the folder of the data structure or algorithm you want to test:

  ```bash
  cd folder
  ```

4. Compile the `.c` file along with its `main.c` test file:

  ```bash
  gcc -o my_program main.c stack_array.c -Wall -Wextra -pedantic
  ```

5. Run the compiled program:

  ```bash
  ./my_program
  ```
